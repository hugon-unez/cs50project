Our implementation of our project has multiple sets of functions that can be imported and work together. This allows us to have a relatively clean block of code in our app.py file because there is code running in the background that is not displayed here. This made it more straightforward to idenfity errors and visualize the flow of our code. To make this function properly, we used import functions to bring in the functions from other files in the project.

<!-- description of learning model -->
We decided to use a machine learning model to make predictions about stock data. Once the API obtains the time data, we can begin to transform the data to be compatible with the learning model.
