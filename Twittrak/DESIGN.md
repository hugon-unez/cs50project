We decided to implement our project with multiple functions that work together in our app.py file. This means that we can perform relatively complex operations while still maintaining a clean workspace and still be able to easily indentify errors. This becasue defining functions compartamentalizes our code, which can allow us to locate where errors are. In addition, defining functions moves some of the code to other files, which means that our main app.py file can be much cleaner visually. This allows us to better show and understand the flow of our code. 

We decided to implement a machine learning model to make predictions in our project. This allows us to use more data to make more accurate predictions than we would be able to do otherwise. In order to accomplish this, we used sklearn in addition to pandas and numpy. First, we take in the price and time data from the APIs that will be used to train our model. This includes the price 1 minute before a tweet is published, the price 5 minutes after, and the trading volume. In order to make the data compatible with our model, we next convert it to a pandas dataframe. The prices allow us to perform some simple math to calculate the change in price over the time interval and store these values in a new column. Next, we store the price changes in a separate list "y". We also create a dataframe "X" that only includes the opening price and volume data. 

Then, we supply X and Y to the sklearn decision tree regressor. We ask the model to try and predict the changes (stored in y) for the opening price and volume (stored in X) for each time the user has published a tweet. We made sure to set the random state to a constant value in order to have reproducable result if supplied with the same data. We also tuned the model with the maximum depth, and we found that 3 layers provides accurate results without taking up too much time or memory. Next, we fit the model to the data we obtained from the APIs. After that, we obtain the current price and volume (stored as "recent_data"). Next, we use the predict function with the recent data to predict the change in stock price if the user publishes a tweet now.
