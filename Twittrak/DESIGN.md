We decided to implement our project with multiple functions that work together in our app.py file. This means that we can perform relatively complex operations while still maintaining a clean workspace and still be able to easily indentify errors. This becasue defining functions compartamentalizes our code, which can allow us to locate where errors are. In addition, defining functions moves some of the code to other files, which means that our main app.py file can be much cleaner visually. This allows us to better show and understand the flow of our code.
