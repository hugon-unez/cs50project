These are the instructions to run our project.


First, the operator should download the relevant files that we submitted to the project assignment. After this, the operator should import the files to their choice of software to run python code (we chose to use vs code). Next, the operator should open the integrated terminal and ensure that their codespace is up to date. The operator should also ensure that the proper packages are imported. In order to install the proper packages, the user should execute the following lines in their terminal:
pip install numpy (this will install numpy)
pip install pandas (this will install pandas, a data science package)
pip install sklearn (this will install sklearn, a machine learning package)
pip install requests (this will install requests)
pip install pytz (this will install pytz)
pip install tweepy (this will install tweepy)

In addition the operator should make sure that they have downloaeded the os and json files.
